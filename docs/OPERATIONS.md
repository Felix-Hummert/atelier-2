# Operations

Audience: the human operator deciding how this installation is started,
stopped, redeployed, how an executor toolchain is pinned, or how an older
store is raised to the current schema.

This file owns that runbook. It does not own product intent, requirement
sentences, or trust-boundary decisions. [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) says what
exists; [ADR 0009](decisions/0009-runner-trust.md) owns network hardening and
reachability; [ADR 0001](decisions/0001-durable-runtime.md) owns the schema
versions and fingerprints. This file only says how the packaged process is
started, how a predecessor store is raised offline, and how a deployment pins
an executor toolchain.

No operations owner existed. [docs/README.md](README.md) now names this file
for that question. [Journeys](journeys/) illustrate requirements and bind
nothing.

## Disposable Serve candidate

The repository `Dockerfile` bakes the locked project and production cockpit
into one provider-free Serve image. It has no provider executable,
credential/configuration mount, host home, scratch mount, Docker socket,
system service access, added capability, privileged mode, or Runner service.
It runs non-root with a read-only root filesystem, dropped capabilities and
`no-new-privileges`. Its only writable durable state is one Compose-named
`store` volume.

Start it from a clean checkout at a committed tree:

```bash
bash scripts/container_up.sh
```

The script refuses dirty, untracked, or unreadable source before Docker, then
archives the resolved commit into a temporary build context. It binds that
commit and tree to image and Compose resource labels, creates a fresh Compose
project, waits for `/atelier/api/v1/health` to report that same identity, and
only then prints the Docker-assigned loopback URL. A private candidate-lifecycle
descriptor freezes its teardown shape, so the shell-quoted
`down --volumes --rmi local --remove-orphans` command carries the exact identity
without ambient variables or a mutable checkout. It removes only this
candidate's container, network, volume and local project image; errors and
interrupts attempt that same cleanup and preserve the descriptor for retry when
it fails. Successful teardown removes it. Other containers and services are not
selected or changed. A rerun creates a new disposable candidate. The current Core
`ExactOutput` executor can still serve its fixture; this package supplies no
external provider or Runner.

## Pin an executor toolchain

The atelier owns the executor copies it serves. The operator's daily CLI
(`~/.local/bin/claude`, `~/.local/bin/grok`, `~/.local/bin/codex`) may update
freely and is not the pin. Point `--claude-executable`, `--grok-executable`,
or `--codex-executable` at an atelier toolchain, not at those host binaries.

Install one already-conformant release into
`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/atelier2-toolchains`:

```bash
uv run --locked python scripts/install_executor_toolchain.py --provider claude --version 2.1.233
uv run --locked python scripts/install_executor_toolchain.py --provider codex
uv run --locked python scripts/install_executor_toolchain.py --provider grok --from /path/to/the-conformant-grok
```

The script prints the absolute executable path. It imports
`CONFORMANT_CLAUDE_VERSIONS`, `CONFORMANT_GROK_VERSIONS`, and
`CONFORMANT_CODEX_VERSIONS` from the subscription adapters and does not keep a
second list. Claude's set has more than one member, so the fenced command
includes `--version` with one of them. After the tree lands, the script asks
the binary `--version` and refuses an answer that is not that selected member.

Claude and Codex are fetched with `npm install` into an isolated prefix
(`node_modules/.bin/claude` or `codex`). Grok is a standalone binary, not an
npm package: pass `--from` to a conformant executable and the script copies it
to `grok-<version>/grok`. `--from` copies an already-held executable into that
layout instead of fetching.

This script does not alter a running Serve, download during `serve`, or resolve
the executable path from admission. Those remain later slices of the toolchain
item.

## Raise an older store

Runtime startup still refuses every predecessor (`MigrationRequired`) and
does not alter the file. The offline command is the tool that refusal names:

```bash
atelier2 migrate --database /path/to/atelier.sqlite
```

Stop the process that owns the file first. The command refuses a write lock
it can see; an idle reader is not always visible, so stopping the serve is
the operator's gate. It does not create a store, does not start a server, and
does not open a runtime.

The file is inspected, then raised one published step at a time. Each step
ends with the fingerprint [ADR 0001](decisions/0001-durable-runtime.md) names.
Any doubt rolls the transaction back, so a failed hop leaves the predecessor
unaltered. Today the built steps run from schema version 13 to the current one, each
either an additive table home or a rebuild that copies every predecessor row. Older published predecessors, and unknown or future
versions, are refused by name. A store already on the current schema is left
unaltered and said to be already current.

## What this slice does not do

- **Live cutover.** The candidate selects no existing process, port, container,
  network or volume; it is not a replacement action.
- **Runner or provider execution.** The image supplies neither. A Start may
  reach existing Core `ExactOutput` behavior, but A.0 proves no external call.
- **CI image build.** CI checks the cheap recipe contract. The release/local
  gate, after a reviewed clean commit, builds, inspects, browses, restarts and
  tears down the candidate. Network hardening beyond its loopback publication
  stays with ADR 0009.

## Measure concurrent fake-executor load

This is a measurement of the current SQLite instance, not a capacity promise
and not a billed-provider run. CI keeps two concurrent runs so the suite stays
cheap. A larger local sweep reuses the same harness on one process:

```bash
ATELIER2_LOAD_CONCURRENCY=96 uv run --locked pytest --dist loadgroup -n 0 tests/integration/test_sqlite_load_measurement.py -s
```

`-n 0` keeps the instance on one worker. The report names the start door, the
event-write door, and one SSE reader per run, then the first observed pressure.
Raise `ATELIER2_LOAD_CONCURRENCY` until a named refusal appears; the 503 knee
was not reached at 96 on 2026-08-19 (`ed6376b`) and stays leftover.
Writer-lock, process spawn, watchdog cgroup, and memory are named only when
the harness observes them.

## Verification

Container recipes:

`uv run --locked pytest --dist loadgroup -n auto tests/tooling/test_container_packaging.py`

That job exercises the recipes and the start script with a fake `docker`.
It does not build a real image.

Store migration:

`uv run --locked pytest --dist loadgroup -n auto tests/integration/test_store_migration.py`

Pinned toolchain:

`uv run --locked pytest --dist loadgroup -n auto tests/tooling/test_install_executor_toolchain.py`

Fake-executor load (CI n=2):

`uv run --locked pytest --dist loadgroup -n auto tests/integration/test_sqlite_load_measurement.py`
